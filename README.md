# 🏖 Node API Playground

A place to do Node API shit. It's currently a super naive REST API written in Typescript...

## Installation

* `npm i`

## Development

* `npm start`

This starts a server on port 3000 that reloads on file changes.

* `npm run docker` (requires Docker)

Build and start a Docker image for local development.
